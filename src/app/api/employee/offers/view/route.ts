/**
 * POST /api/employee/offers/view
 *
 * Records that the authenticated employee has *viewed* an offer.
 *
 * Business rules (per spec):
 *   - One unique view per (offerId, employeeId).
 *   - The view is recorded once; reopening the same offer does NOT
 *     increase the count.
 *   - viewCount on MerchantOffer represents UNIQUE employee views.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *   - The unique constraint on (offerId, employeeId) is the source of
 *     truth for "first view vs repeat view".
 *   - A single CTE statement performs the insert-or-skip AND the
 *     conditional viewCount increment atomically in one round-trip.
 *   - The view row is inserted; if it conflicts (already viewed),
 *     the UPDATE is a no-op (no rows joined).
 *
 * Raw SQL is used here because the current Prisma client was
 * generated before the OfferView model was added to the schema.
 * When the dev environment regenerates the client, the route can
 * be migrated to `prisma.offerView` (a follow-up that does not
 * change the runtime semantics).
